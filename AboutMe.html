                Now it's time to get to know me!
                <br> <br>
                My name is Meagan Vu (pronounced May-gan not Me-gen). I'm a junior at Santa Clara University studying Computer Science Engineering. 
                Originally, I enrolled at SCU as a business student, but immediately after I took my first computer science class, I knew coding was my calling. 
                Last summer, I interned for the National Science Foundation as a Machine Learning Researcher where we found solutions for Cybersecurity using ML methods.
                Apart from that, I am the Director of Events for the biggest Women in CS club on campus, ACM-W (if you're a girly in CS at SCU stop by!) Other than that,
                I have been a dog mom for 6 months to a dog we rescued from the streets. His name is Dobby. I also love to weightlift and have been for 6 years.

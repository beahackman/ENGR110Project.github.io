                I have a great interest in computers and all the Computer-related kinds of stuff inspired by my gaming experience. I have learned multiple languages by myselfâ€”for example, C++, Java, Python, and a few amounts of Linux. I am attracted to exploring the knowledge that I don't know and challenging me.

                I'm a second-year computer science student pursuing an emphasis in security. I have a background in customer service and am eager to use my skills in python, data management and interdisciplinary collaboration to help the UCCE bridge the gap with the public on environmental issues and gain hands-on engineering experience in Santa Clara.

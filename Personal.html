            <h1>Week 3</h1>
            <p>
                Week 3 mainly consisted of the team getting a better understanding of the project and which aspects of last quarter's
                project we wanted to tackle. Part of this process was setting up an interview with our main point of contact, Victoria.
                The Sunday prior to the interview, we sat down and dicussed what questions we wanted to ask her and ranking them based off
                of priority as we only had a 30 minute time slot.

                <br><br>
                During the actual meeting, my role was to ask Victoria the questions. We were able to ask most of our questions in full, gaining
                a better understanding for what the goals and aspirations that UCCE CEP had for this quarter. At the end of the meeting, we agreed to
                meet with Victoria once a week to ask questions or update on our progress. For both the inital meeting and the recurring meetings, I set
                up the zoom link and sent out a google calendar invite.

                <br><br>
                During the weekend after Week 3, I looked into the previous team's github, to try to understand their implementations. This 
                provided me an idea of the scope of the project and how high we should aim for the rest of the quarter. After considering Victoria's wants
                and with a better understanding of the difficulty of the project, I pitched to the team that we should focus on two aspects for the quarter.
                The first is to implement meaningful results as the current results from the calculator are a little difficult to understand and don't 
                make much of an impact. The second is to provide a secondary page on how to accurately track how much one composts. These are two 
                needs that Victoria pointed out in the meeting and I believe that we can accomplish this within the alloted timeframe.

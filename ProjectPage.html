                The UCCE started in 1891 where the University of California Board of Regents created minor courses to access students from all over the state. The main goal of UCCE as an organization is to support “sustainable, safe, and nutritious food production and delivery”, drive economic success, create a sustainable, healthy and productive environment, and improve science literacy and youth development through their programs.  The main point of the Composting Education Program is to educate surrounding communities on how to compost and about the benefits of composting, waste reduction and gardening. Their target audience is not only limited to adults, but they also reach out to children/adolescents by school presentations throughout the county of Santa Clara. They even offer an additional program called the Master Composter course where they participate in a 15-17 week course with lecturers ranging from university academics to industry leaders. They also supply resources on where they get the materials needed for composting on their website. Their site location is 5283 Snell Ave in San Jose where they have composting areas on site for people to learn and see first hand the power of composting. Their team is made up of full time staff in addition to the help of volunteers.

                The specific project that I want to work on is the back-end development of their data analysis tool. A really large part of UCCE’s goal is to have large community engagement thus in September of 2023, Dylan Savage, Xiomara Quinonez, Jason Cisneros, and Zach Teal, they developed a web browser extension that allowed users to enter their composting habits and data which then outputted how their contributed helped Santa Clara County as a whole.

                I'm really interested in how the team was able to develop a user-friendly version of data storage so that other less experienced volunteers would have an easier time working on and accessing the inner workings of the program if necessary. Finding the best option, while still being user friendly requires knowledge and research about different technologies and by being a part of this team would allow me to be educated on different options for data collection. Lots of programmers want to come up with the most impressive structure for their program, leading to those without previous education on programming to shy away from touching the code. I think it’s really admirable of the creators to look outside the box to come up with ways to collect data while simultaneously allowing future UCCE volunteers and staff to have an easier time keeping the program up to date. For example, the team initially wanted to use Amazon Web Services (AWS) but on further discussion with the UCCE, it was clear that it would be too costly and complex, thus they opted for Google sheets and the Google Cloud Project.
